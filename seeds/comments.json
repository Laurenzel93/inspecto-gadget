The underground is outside but not considered a W&S.  I wanted a test the first time when I failed it.  I got a call from the Plumber today to ask me if I could go back out there today.  I did and there was no test again.  He was assuming that since it e=was outside he wouldn�t need a test. My sticker says he still needs a test.  So far I�ve had 2 inspections there. He should probably be billed for the 2 inspections.\n Thanks,\n Steve",
